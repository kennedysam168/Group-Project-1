## Prototype
Our first week prototype will be a rough draft of our final product. In this rough draft we will aim to have the API's functioning so the service can be used, as well as some basic layout design completed. We are planning to get the service up and running and then focus on all the smaller design details.


## First Tasks
The first tasks for the group members are as follows:
- Mallory and Sam will Work on the initial rough layout of the webpage
- Russ and Christian will work on implementing the API's
- Once Sam and Mallory are finish they will assist in the the API integration and the javascript coding
